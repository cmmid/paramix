Description: The `paramix` package provides a convenient framework for aggregating
    and disaggregating continuously varying parameters (for example, case fatality
    ratio, with age) for proper parametrization of lower-resolution compartmental
    models (for example, with broad age categories) and subsequent upscaling of
    model outputs at high resolution (for example, as needed when calculating
    age-sensitive measures like years-life-lost).
