Description: The `YLLr` package provides a convenient framework for aggregating
    and disaggregating age-dependent effects, for example case fatality ratio,
    for proper parametrization of of lower-resolution compartmental models - that
    is, with relatively broad age bins - and subsequent upscaling of model outputs
    for use when calculating age-sensitive measures like years-life-lost.
