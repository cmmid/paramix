# QUICK START

You will need `gnumake` (or other `make` with compatible syntax support), `R`,
and the `renv` `R` package installed.

To run the analysis, go to a command prompt and enter:

```bash
path/to/this/directory$ make
```

You will be prompted by `renv` to agree to setting up the `renv` library.
The `socialmixr` dependency tree is sprawling, so will this may take a moment.
